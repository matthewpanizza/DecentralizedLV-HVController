// Let Device OS manage the connection to the Particle Cloud
SYSTEM_MODE(MANUAL);

// setup() runs once, when the device is first turned on
void setup() {
  // Put initialization like pinMode and begin functions here

// loop() runs over and over again, as quickly as it can execute.
void loop() {
  // The core of your code will likely live here.

  // Example: Publish event to cloud every 10 seconds. Uncomment the next 3 lines to try it!
  // Log.info("Sending Hello World to the cloud!");
  // Particle.publish("Hello world!");
  // delay( 10 * 1000 ); // milliseconds and blocking - see docs for more info!
